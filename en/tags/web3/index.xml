      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September: Initial Setup and Code Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, I was tasked with renewing an existing blockchain wallet that had already been deployed on Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first took on this project, I felt completely overwhelmed. The existing project was developed in Vue 2, and I had to modify it. Additionally, since Chrome follows the Manifest policy, I had to study that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Manifest v3 issue was there from the start, and since I was more familiar with React, I thought about rewriting the whole project from scratch. I attempted it, but I wasn’t confident enough to restructure everything from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
