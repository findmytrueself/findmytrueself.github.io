However, I have no connections here at all.</p><p>Ultimately, if I want to live, I need to establish myself in the metropolitan area, but that’s when I have to constantly grapple with housing issues.</p><p><strong>To Survive</strong></p><p>Have you thought about your monthly fixed expenses?</p><p>Among these, the largest cost is housing, which is money that goes out just for breathing.</p><p>In fact, what is the reason we earn money?</p><p>I believe we earn money to seek a better quality of life.</p><p>To improve the quality of life, I need to save a lump sum, but in this place, just breathing incurs expenses.</p><p>Making money is not easy, but spending it is all too simple.</p><p><strong>The Reason I Took Out the LH Jeonse Loan</strong></p><p>Back in 2021, when I was studying development, I often wondered how I could buy a better and cheaper house in the future, so I browsed various sites.</p><p>Among them, I first applied for the Happy Housing in Mapo and then for the LH 3rd priority.</p><p>I assumed that the Happy Housing in Mapo would be competing against people from the metropolitan area and the same district, so I applied for a shared unit.</p><p>Fortunately, LH had a lucky 3rd priority selection process, allowing me to apply as a young person or job seeker since my income hadn’t been assessed.</p><p>After that, there was no news for several months.</p><p>By that time, I had already secured employment and was anxiously moving between different goshiwons (one-room accommodations).</p><p>The really frustrating thing is that just because it&rsquo;s a goshiwon doesn’t mean the rent is cheap.</p><p><strong>How Did I Search for a House?</strong></p><p>Currently, my workplace is located in Bundang, and while I was considering whether I could still go for the Happy Housing I applied for in Mapo, I ended up getting an income during the review process, which disqualified me from the Happy Housing list.</p><p>The only options left were the LH Jeonse loan, general youth jeonse loan, or the Didiimdol jeonse loan.</p><p>In fact, the only places that provide 100% of the jeonse loan are the LH Jeonse loan and the small business youth loan.</p><p>Ironically, finding a room where 100% of the loan is available is harder than finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>All the houses that seemed decent were not eligible.</p><p>So, while working, I made time to ride my motorcycle and checked out almost all the houses in southern Gyeonggi Province.</p><p>I wanted to find a house as close to Bundang as possible, but there was so much demand for LH or small business loans in Bundang that almost all of them were not available.</p><p>Furthermore, with interest rates continuing to rise, I was worried about managing the interest if I took out a different loan, and I was also afraid of falling victim to rental scams.</p><p>So, I had very few options: either a low deposit with monthly rent or using the LH Jeonse loan.</p><p><em>Advantages of LH Jeonse Loan</em></p><p><strong>There’s no risk of rental scams.</strong></p><p>This is because the loan is not based on a contract between me and the landlord but rather a contract between LH Corporation and the landlord.</p><p>This allows for a high level of trust when signing the contract.</p><p>Once the rights analysis is approved, the attorney will handle everything on the contract date.</p><p><strong>100% Jeonse Loan</strong></p><p>These days, house prices are incredibly high, so even if you get an 80% loan for a house worth 100 million KRW, you’ll still need 20 million KRW.</p><p>But the funny thing is that a house with a 100 million KRW jeonse that’s available for loan is unlikely to be a good one.</p><p>In fact, considering the interest, there’s hardly any difference from monthly rent.</p><p>In some cases, renting might actually be more beneficial since you won’t fall victim to rental scams.</p><p>The LH Jeonse loan provides a 100% loan with a fixed interest rate of 2%. Depending on the individual, a preferential interest rate of 0.5% can also be applied.</p><p><em>Disadvantages of LH Jeonse Loan</em></p><p><strong>You have to live in houses that people generally don’t want to stay in.</strong></p><p>Since my primary goal was to minimize my rent, I had to rely on LH as much as possible.</p><p>So, when I went to see rooms, I thought I could just settle for any decent place. But to my shock, there were so many houses in terrible condition.</p><p>However, it was really hard to find something decent, which was disappointing enough to make me consider giving up on LH altogether.</p><p><strong>How I Ended Up Finding a Room</strong></p><p>While exploring various neighborhoods, I tried to find a place as close to the Shinbundang Line as possible.</p><p>If I could take the Shinbundang Line, I could easily access Gangnam, Pangyo, Jeongja (where my company is), and Gwanggyo, and the line is expected to expand further.</p><p>Of course, the prices are higher in that area, but when I use the Shinbundang Line, the quality of life improves.</p><p>So while looking at rooms accessible by bus, I discovered a building undergoing a full renovation.</p><p>Although the building was old, the two-room unit was clean inside, so I judged that it was the best option given my situation and signed the contract immediately.</p><p>I ended up choosing a semi-jeonse option, which requires paying a bit more in rent, but I felt it was better than not finding a place at all.</p><p>The downside is that there are no options included, so I have to purchase everything myself.</p><p>Now I am waiting for the move-in date. My commuting time will increase, but in the future, I plan to work from home occasionally to try to minimize my commuting time.</p><p><strong>Reflections</strong></p><p>Since I have mostly lived in apartments, I haven’t experienced the inconveniences of living in villas, but I expect to feel that as I continue living here.</p><p>Still, I feel proud that I was able to find a home on my own.</p><p>With so much money taken from CodeXXXX, my priority was to minimize my monthly expenses.</p><p>With more space, my quality of life will naturally improve, and I expect to have more activities I can do at home.</p></article><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//https-findmytrueself-github-io.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div></div></main><footer class="flex flex-none justify-center"><section class="flex flex-col md:flex-row mx-2 md:mx-0 gap-2 md:gap-0 justify-between w-full max-w-4xl lg:max-w-5xl py-6 text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300"><div class="flex flex-row"><a href=https://github.com/findmytrueself target=_blank title=GitHub class="flex flex-row mr-2"><span class=hidden>GitHub</span>
